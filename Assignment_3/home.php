            <p>My name is Matt Resnikoff. I am currently a Junior at the U of R, majoring in Economics and double minoring in Computer Science and Journalism. I got into Comp Sci fairly recently, but I have a lot of fun with the coding aspects which is why I decided to start off as the group coder. I really like tennis, both watching and playing.</p>
